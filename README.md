# Hospital-Adminstration-Dashboard

Problem Statement:

The goal of this analysis was to understand key factors related to hospital admissions, readmissions, medical procedures, and patient demographics. By analyzing the dataset, we aimed to uncover patterns and insights that could help improve hospital management, optimize patient care, and reduce readmission rates. The analysis covers metrics like average days in the hospital, the number of readmitted patients, medical specialties, and patient characteristics such as gender, race, and age groups.

What I Did:

1. Data Cleaning: Firstly I cleaned the data using excel.

2. Visualized Key Metrics:

Average Days in Hospital: Displayed the average time patients spend in the hospital.

Readmission Analysis: Analyzed the number of readmitted patients and the reasons behind it.

Medical Specialties: Investigated the distribution of medical specialties in relation to patient care.

2. Demographics Analysis:

Gender and Race Distribution: Analyzed patient demographics based on gender and race to understand the hospital's patient composition.

Age Group Analysis: Visualized patient distributions across various age groups to assess the healthcare needs of different populations.

3. Patient Care Patterns:

Medical Procedure Analysis: Visualized the types of medical procedures conducted and their correlation with patient demographics.

Readmission vs. Medical Specialties: Correlated readmission rates with medical specialties to identify potential areas of improvement.

Tools Used:

Microsoft Excel: Used for data cleaning, processing, and creating detailed visualizations using pivot tables, charts, and graphs.

Excel's Built-in Analytics Features: Pivot charts, data slicers, and conditional formatting were used to enhance the visualizations.

Recommendations:

1. Focus on Readmission Reduction: Given the high number of readmissions, hospitals should implement initiatives such as follow-up care programs or more efficient discharge processes to minimize unnecessary readmissions.

2. Specialty Focused Resource Allocation: Focus more resources on medical specialties with high patient volumes and readmission rates, such as Emergency Care or Cardiology, to improve patient outcomes.

3. Targeted Patient Support: For age groups with higher hospitalizations, implement age-specific care plans to reduce hospital stays and improve recovery times.

4. Improve Hospital Experience: Address patient care gaps related to the gender and race distribution by creating personalized care strategies and support systems tailored to diverse demographic groups.

Conclusion:

The hospital administration analysis provided a clear picture of the hospital’s operational challenges, such as high readmission rates and varying patient needs based on demographic factors. By focusing on reducing readmission rates, optimizing resource allocation across specialties, and addressing specific demographic challenges, hospitals can improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. The insights derived from this analysis can guide hospital management in making data-driven decisions that ultimately enhance operational efficiency and patient care.
